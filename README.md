# PokeSearch

This app uses Firebase Geofire for its backend. If app users spot a pokemon at their location, they can simply press to the poke ball icon to alert other app users about the pokemon and the location that they have found it. 

If users would like to drive to the pokemon's location to catch it, they can simply click on the maps icon next to the pokemon's name. Then the app uses Apple maps to plot directions to the pokemon automatically for the user. 

Currently, the app contains the original 150 pokemon, along with their identification names.
